# Tesla-Theater-YT-BUG
Since the tesla web browser doesn't natively allow users to fullscreen pages, I've created a dashboard that users can place all their favorite sites as applets that allows for them to become effortlessly full-screen due to the well-known "youtube bug" that results in a youtube redirect (which initializes the youtube app that is fullscreen)
